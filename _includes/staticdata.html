MSMEs are hugely preferred by small-town folks and it would be interesting to note that at present, there are more than 600 crore MSMEs operational in India. The contribution of MSMEs to the growth of Indian economy is significant.</p>

    <p>CGTMSE The government of India has tied up with SIDBI (Small industries development bank f India) and created the CGTMSE or the Credit Guarantee Trust for Micro and small enterprises. It came into being on 30 August, 2000. Individuals can avail loans up to INR 1 crore under the CGTMSE and the borrowers are required to have a registered business and are expected to submit a concrete and feasible business plan at the time of applying for the loan. Repayment schedules are flexible that expend up to 5 years. The loan is disbursed through MLIs (Member lending institutions), which can be any scheduled commercial bank (PSUs, foreign or private banks) and selected state rural banks and finance corporations. The interest rate is charged by the MLIs as per the existing RBI guidelines, which should not exceed the PLR (Prime lending rates) by more than 3%. For example, if the PLR of SBI is 10%, the interest it can charge on a CGTMSE collateral free loan cannot be more than 13% (10% + 3%).
